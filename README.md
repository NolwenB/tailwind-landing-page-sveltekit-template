## ‚ùó Note

This project was originally made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) by [Cruip.com](https://cruip.com/) in [the repository here](https://github.com/cruip/tailwind-landing-page-template). This repo uses **v2.4.0** of the project which was released under the _GPL License_.
Thanks for the nice template üëç

The project has been translated by me to use SvelteKit. The project uses newly created components and makes use of Sveltekit's [logic blocks](https://svelte.dev/docs/logic-blocks) not seen in the Next.js template for making the code (hopefully) easier to modify or edit.

# Free Tailwind landing page template

**Simple Light** is a free landing page template built on top of _Tailwind CSS_ and fully coded using the _Sveltekit_ framework and _TypeScript_. Simple light is designed to provide all the basic components a developer need to create a landing page for SaaS products, online services, and more.

## Usage

This is template uses [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) which was installed using _[this guide](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/creating-a-project)_.
Additionally, _[this guide](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-with-tailwind-css)_ by _Joy Of Code_ was helpful for initially setting up Tailwind CSS for this project.
His YouTube Channel is full of useful tutorials on Svelte. Check him out [here](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-with-tailwind-css).
